this is a project that i plan to continue to work on:

this program will provide a golfer what club they should use depending upon 
multiple factors affecting their shot such as wind, slope, and temperature.
methods are created to adjust the yardage the golfer will have to account 
from their inputs.  the golfer will need to set up the distances upfront
on how far they hit each club and this will be stored into a database titled 
as their name. users will then be able to update a club distance, delete a club,
and/or add a club to their database. once the questions regarding the shot 
conditions are answered, the program will print the club for the golfer to use 
based off the adjusted yardage. 

i am trying to work out setting up clubs to have a range of yardage.  until
then, all clubs will have one value at what I am calling the "nearest 10th".
i will then round the adjusted yardage to nearest 10th. ex. adj yards is 167.3,
will round to 170.  adj yards is 142.89, will round to 140.  this will allow
the code to provide a matched club from the database as long as that yaradge
was entered.
